**What is USDT (Tether)?**

USDT is one of the most popular stablecoins that was originally issued on the bitcoin protocol through the Omni Layer, but it has since then migrated to other blockchains as well and so exists as a cryptocurrency token.

Tether is issued by Tether Limited â€” limited company incorporated pursuant to the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance. 

Additionally, Tether is registered as a Money Services Business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of Treasury. 

**Where can I purchase USDT?**

USDT can be found in various exchanges such as Binance, Okex, Huobi, HitBTC and Bitfinex. 

Besides that, USDT can also be acquired by submitting US dollars to Tether Limited
