# How to add Polygon network in Metamask

![](../../.gitbook/assets/how-to-add-poly-to-metamask.gif)

1. Delete the current Polygon (Matic) network from Metamask. (You can skip this if you haven't added it yet)
2. Switch back to Ethereum mainnet.
3. Go to the [Bridge](https://app.halodao.com/#/bridge) page and tap our network switcher (upper right to the left of the RNBW balance).
4. Choose Polygon (Matic) network
5. Tap `Approve` (this will automatically add the new RPC URL that works and loads the Farm and Pool pages [https://polygon-rpc.com/](https://polygon-rpc.com/))
