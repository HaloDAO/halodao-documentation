# üêá Our Mascot

![Get To Know HeyHey](<../.gitbook/assets/photo\_2021-05-20 13.20.00.jpeg>)

Our mascot's name is Heyhey. Its namesake comes from the word 'Mabuhay' in tagalog, a common greeting used in the Philippines, which is synonymous with 'good life'. Heyhey was born with a sweet tooth and a spirit of adventure. To satisfy its sweet craving, Heyhey is on an intergalactic adventure to find new tasty treats. Its first stop to find these delicious treats is the Halo Planet! There he can swap, lend and borrow ingredients to put together the best mix of dessert yields found on new planets to create tastier treats.

Our gitbook and online materials represent an activity log of Heyhey's journey with HaloDAO as we work towards the next phase of crypto expansion.

Join us as we go intergalactic!
