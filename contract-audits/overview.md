# Overview

At HaloDAO, when we create a new contract we first deploy it on our beta app. This is usually done on a testnet and then double-checked on our mainnet beta version, to ensure that everything is working as expected before deployment to the HaloDAO dapp. A few of the major steps completed during the Beta phase include:

* conduct bug bounties to attempt to drain the contract
* Security Audits by a third party;    
* Complete correction of all issues found during the Audit period before deployment to live production dapp.

Once the contract goes through those stages, it is then deployed to our Production App.
