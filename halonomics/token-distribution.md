# Token Distribution

The above diagram illustrates the breakdown of the 100 million supply capped HALO governance tokens. 25% of HaloDAO tokens has been sold in our Private Sale and 5% will be sold in the Public Round. 5% will be kept for ecosystem support, such as grants, hackathons and other activities. 10% is reserved for future fundraising to support the continued development and adoption of the Protocol. 35%, the largest allocation, will be rewarded to incentivise liquidity providers who will create and seed markets with region-specific stablecoin liquidity. 20% will be used to incentivise the team for long term participation in the project.

Liquidity Rewards

A total of 35M HALO tokens will be rewarded to liquidity providers for a target duration of 5 years. The distribution schedule will follow a decaying growth function in order to reward early adopters and then approach a zero limit towards the 60th month from launch as the HALO market cap grows. The exact proportion of HALO rewards between AMM LPs, Lending Market LPs and collateral LPs \(to mint synthetics\) will be determined closer to the public token launch. This regular disbursement of liquidity rewards tokens may be revisited by the community every few months as the Protocol grows and may be increased or decreased to match the incentivisation alignment needs of present and future liquidity providers. For the moment, however, the calculation is pegged to a 5 year emission schedule, starting at roughly 6.5M tokens as rewards for the first month gradually decreasing to a 0 limit at the 60th month.   


Monthly HALO Liquidity Rewards will follow a decay curve function that will be fixed for the specific month, but paid out linearly per block within that month. At current network parameters, HALO is rewarded on every block linearly within a month’s epoch;  


HALOreward\_per\_block=CollateralstakedTotalCollateralstaked\*RewardsRatio \*  HALOblock\_reward  


Where;

*  Collateralstaked is the liquidity provider’s total collateral provided
* TotalCollateralstaked is the total collateral provided by all liquidity providers
* RewardsRatio is the total rewards allocated for a particular dApp \(AMM/Lending Market/Synthetic Minter\)
* HALOblock\_reward  is the linear reward per block for that specific epoch \(each epoch equalling one month and each subsequent month following the decaying rewards function\)

At current network parameters, it will take ~5 years for the HALO Rewards Pool to empty. Before that happens, however, the Foundation \(or any other HALO token holder\) may propose a buyback vote which will replenish the HALO Rewards Pool for Liquidity Providers. Of course, at any time HALO holders may propose a vote to enact any miscellaneous action, such as burning HALO upon buyback or to alter the minute network parameters to react to market changes.

  
Team Rewards

20 million HALO tokens are allocated to the team to incentivise good work to advance Protocol objectives. Roughly 325,000 HALO per month will be paid to the core team for the same 60 months schedule. 

Ecosystem

5 million HALO tokens will be reserved as ecosystem support for wallet builders, payment processors or any other financial institutions that want to make use of HaloDAO’s stablecoin liquidity. HaloDAO will provide any SDKs or tooling that might make it easier for these entities to onboard into the permissionless and borderless commerce inherent to Decentralised Finance \(DeFi\). Additionally, the Ecosystem fund could also provide grants and any other assistance to potential adopters of regional stablecoins.

  
Investment

Last but not least, institutional money is necessary to get the initial team and product off the ground. For this reason, the team has allocated a total of 35M tokens to sell for the current private and public rounds \(including a future funds reserve\) to fund initial development, liquidity, launch and future development.
