**FX Automated Market Maker \(AMM\)**

HaloDAO will incentivise liquidity provision and trading between Asian asset backed stablecoins, synthetic stablecoins, and important pairings between those stablecoins and popular currencies, such as ETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, etc. 

  
**Lending Protocol**

It is not enough to simply mint a region-specific stablecoin, and provide liquidity to an AMM. The goal of HaloDAO is to build up a regional lending and borrowing market for Asia-specific stablecoins so that end-users will be able to get a regional currency-denominated interest rate on their holdings - essentially “local currency farming”. 

**Stablecoin Minter**

HaloDAO relies on a core integration with UMA’s [DVM](https://docs.umaproject.org/oracle/econ-architecture) that provides a “priceless oracle” mechanism to mint synthetic stablecoins at a price feed relative to collateral tokens and the target regional currency.
