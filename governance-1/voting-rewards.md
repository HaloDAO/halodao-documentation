# ðŸŽ–Voting Rewards

The foundation will release a voting portal that will allow any HALO token holder to stake and vote on proposals initiated by other HALO token holders. 

$$
{\text{Stablecoin_Reward}}_\text{epoch}=\frac{\text{Halo}_\text{staked}}{{\text{TotalHalo}}_\text{staked}}\ast{\text{TotalIncome}}_\text{epoch}
$$

Where**:**

1. A single epoch is set at 1 month
2. $$\text{Halo}_\text{staked}$$ is the voterâ€™s total HALO balance staked to vote for a specific proposal.
3. $$\text{TotalHalo}_\text{staked}$$is the sum of all voterâ€™s total HALO balance staked to vote for a specific proposal.

Total Income epoch is the current percentage of HALO token holder dividends out of network profits.

A userâ€™s stablecoin reward is calculated by taking their proportion of staked and voting HALO and multiplying that by the total income earned by the Protocol during a specific block. Those who are actively staked and voting token holders will in turn be compensated per epoch based on their proportion of staked HALO tokens from the total staked and voting HALO supply; and not from the total HALO supply.
