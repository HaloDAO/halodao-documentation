# ðŸŽ– Voting Rewards

The foundation will release a voting portal that will allow any RNBW token holder to stake and vote on proposals initiated by other RNBW token holders. 

$$
{\text{Stablecoin_Reward}}_\text{epoch}=\frac{\text{Rnbw}_\text{staked}}{{\text{TotalRnbw}}_\text{staked}}\ast{\text{TotalIncome}}_\text{epoch}
$$

Where**:**

1. A single epoch is set at 1 month
2. $$\text{Rnbw}_\text{staked}$$ is the voterâ€™s total RNBW balance staked to vote for a specific proposal.
3. $$\text{TotalRnbw}_\text{staked}$$is the sum of all voterâ€™s total RNBW balance staked to vote for a specific proposal.
4. $$\text{TotalIncome}_\text{epoch}$$is the current percentage of RNBW token holder dividends out of network profits.

A userâ€™s stablecoin reward is calculated by taking their proportion of staked and voting RNBW and multiplying that by the total income earned by the Protocol during a specific block. Those who are actively staked and voting token holders will in turn be compensated per epoch based on their proportion of staked RNBW tokens from the total staked and voting RNBW supply; and not from the total RNBW supply.
