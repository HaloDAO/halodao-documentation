# ðŸš€ Governance Model

HaloDAO's voting portal will allow any HALO token holder to stake and vote on proposals initiated by other HALO token holders. Your voting rights are directly proportional to the number of HALO tokens you own.

The  HALO token holders can propose and vote for:

* New economic and geographic regions to expand to. 
* New collateral types and synthetics to support across the AMM, and Lending Market.
* Adjust the HALO burn rate. \(to lessen the total HALO supply over time, funded by the Stablecoin Earnings Pools\)
* When to execute buybacks using funds from the Stablecoin Earnings Pools.
* And many other proposal types.
