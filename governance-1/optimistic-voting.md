# ðŸ—³ Optimistic Voting

![](../.gitbook/assets/governance-protocol%20%282%29.png)

The above diagram is partially taken from [Gnosis SafeSnap](https://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f), which HaloDAO \(among other well -established protocols\) will leverage to enable off-chain voting and on-chain execution of proposals. While development is ongoing, the Safe Owners highlighted in the diagram will be a multisig as safeguard operated by HaloDAO and will hold veto power to proposals. This multisig, however, will be removed once the protocol reaches maturity in roughly a year after launch when most of the protocol components have been built out and battle-tested.
