# 🏦 Lending Market

![](../.gitbook/assets/artboard-1-copy-9.svg)

HaloDAO is building a lending and borrowing market specific to the risk profiles of asset-backed stablecoins, such that that end-users will be able to get a currency-denominated interest rate on their holdings. This essentially enables “local currency farming”.

{% hint style="info" %}
Lending market will be included in the v1 launch. See [roadmap](../roadmap/overview.md).
