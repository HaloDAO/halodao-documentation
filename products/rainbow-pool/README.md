Rainbow pool is the vesting contract that lets you gain high APYs on RNBW without impermanent loss, yet your RNBW tokens are still withdraw-able anytime, at will (youâ€™ll just lose out on monthly RNBW rewards).&#x20;

The protocol enables this by allocating 20% of monthly RNBW liquidity rewards over 5 years into the vesting contract. &#x20;
