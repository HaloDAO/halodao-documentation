**The** ðŸŒˆ**Rainbow contract is HaloDAOâ€™s vesting mechanism that incentivizes you to hold HALO longer, but without locking you into a fixed vesting schedule.**

Rainbow pool is the vesting contract that lets you gain high APYs on HALO without impermanent loss, yet your HALO tokens are still withdraw-able anytime, at will \(youâ€™ll just lose out on monthly HALO rewards\). 

The protocol enables this by allocating 20% of monthly HALO liquidity rewards over 5 years into the vesting contract.
