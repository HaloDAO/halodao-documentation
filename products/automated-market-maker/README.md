HaloDAO will incentivise liquidity provision and trading between Asian asset-backed stablecoins, synthetic stablecoins, and important pairings between those stablecoins and popular currencies, such as ETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, etc.

#### ‚úÖHere are some tips to maximize liquidity for the following pairs:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="RNBW:HALO" %}
* Arbitrage opportunity between claiming from the Rainbow Pool and exchange.
* Increases incentive to hold RNBW.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="USDT:xSGD" %}
* USDT pairing is enough to concentrate HALO rewards for higher APY and because balancer will find multihop swaps into USDC, DAI anyway. For example, when swapping xSGD:USDC, it will go xSGD ‚Üí USDT ‚Üí USDC on its own.
{% endtab %}
