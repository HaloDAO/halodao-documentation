1. Go to [app.halodao.com](http://app.halodao.com/).
2. Go to the Farm tab if not automatically redirected.
3. Select a liquidity pool where you wish to add liquidity to, click “Add”.
4. Follow the link to get more HLP or UNI-V2 tokens \(Only needed if HLP or UNI-V2 balance is 0, otherwise, skip this step\).
5. Enter the amount of HLP or UNI-V2 you want to stake.
6. Click the “Approve” button \(This step is needed in approving the spending amount from your wallet on behalf of the Rewards contract\).
7. Confirm the approve transaction in Metamask. Once the transaction is successful the button will change to “Stake.”
8. Click “Stake” button.
9. Your LP tokens will be staked into the RNBW Rewards smart contract.
10. You will get a proportionate amount of xRNBW vesting tokens from your staked LP tokens relative to the total LP tokens staked for that pool.
11. The longer you hold xRNBW, the more RNBW you receive over time. Read the next section, How Vesting Works, to understand how this is calculated.
