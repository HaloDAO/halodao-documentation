Coming soon

HaloDAO will incentivise liquidity provision and trading between Asian asset backed stablecoins, synthetic stablecoins and important pairings between those stablecoins and popular currencies, such as ETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, etc. The protocolâ€™s AMM will combine a Curve style bonding curve for swaps of similarly priced stablecoin pairs \(such as asset backed and synthetic stablecoins\) and an optimised bonding curve for swapping stablecoin pairs of different prices \(FX trading\).
