## Voting

The foundation will release a voting portal that will allow any HALO token holder to stake and vote on proposals initiated by other HALO token holders.

A userâ€™s stablecoin reward is calculated by taking their proportion of staked and voting HALO and multiplying that by the total income earned by the Protocol during a specific block. Those who are actively staked and voting token holders will in turn be compensated per epoch based on their proportion of staked HALO tokens from the total staked and voting HALO supply; and not from the total HALO supply.
