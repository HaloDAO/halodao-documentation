# Governance

## Voting

The foundation will release a voting portal that will allow any HALO token holder to stake and vote on proposals initiated by other HALO token holders. The initial voting portal will simply be a space on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/halodao.eth) for off chain voting and manual execution by the Foundation. However, as we build out the rest of the protocol, the Foundation will implement off chain voting combined with on chain automated execution for various proposals.
