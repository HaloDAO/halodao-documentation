The core modules enable the:

1. Swapping of region-specific asset-backed stablecoins and synthetic versions where applicable.
2. Minting and redemption of region-specific stablecoins.
3. Lending and borrowing of these region-specific stablecoins.
4. The earning of HALO rewards for actions along with the profit drivers of the above.
5. Governance of the HaloDAO Protocol by HALO token holders who decide on:
   * New economic and geographic regions to expand to. \(new collateral types and synthetics to support across the AMM, Minter and Lending Market\)
   * Adjust the HALO burn rate. \(to lessen the total HALO supply over time, funded by the Stablecoin Earnings Pools\)
   * When to execute buybacks using funds from the Stablecoin Earnings Pools.
   * And many other proposal types.
