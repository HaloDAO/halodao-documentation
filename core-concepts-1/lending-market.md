# Lending Market

Coming soon

It is not enough to simply mint a region-specific stablecoin, and provide liquidity to an AMM. The goal of HaloDAO is to build up a regional lending and borrowing market for Asia specific stablecoins so that end users will be able to get a regional currency-denominated interest rate on their holdings - essentially “local currency farming”. HaloDAO will do this by forking existing lending markets, such as Compound or Cream Finance but focus on listing collateral types representing underserved stablecoins in the Asian region, as well as LP tokens that represent a claim on liquidity provision on our AMM.
