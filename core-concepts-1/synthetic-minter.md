# Synthetic Minter

Coming soon

HaloDAO relies on a core integration with UMA’s [DVM](https://docs.umaproject.org/oracle/econ-architecture) that provides a “priceless oracle” mechanism to mint synthetic stablecoins \(as perpetuals\) at a price feed relative to collateral tokens and the target regional currency. HaloDAO will further incentivise stablecoin liquidity using the synthetic minter, by accepting USD pegged stablecoins, AMM LP tokens \(representing stablecoin liquidity\) and wrapped yield bearing tokens \(lent out stablecoins\) from the Lending Market as collateral to mint more synthetics.
