# HaloDAO FAQs

## What is HaloDAO?

A stablecoin marketplace built to facilitate the minting of synthetics pegged to various Asian currencies, a stablecoin optimized automated market maker to exchange between Asian asset-backed stablecoins and synthetics, and a lending market to generate yield for local currency farming.

## How is HaloDAO different from other DeFi protocols?

HaloDAO is focused on Asian asset-backed stablecoins. Given massive crypto adoption, the future lies in South East Asia. HaloDAO aims to be the dominant stablecoin-friendly DeFi platform operating in the region's emerging economies

The HaloDAO team will drive liquidity to these regional stablecoins through a combination of drivers: tapping global liquidity via liquidity rewards, establishing gaming partnerships, and creating more on and offramps integrations with existing wallets and exchanges around Asia. With a greater supply of local stablecoins, users will be able to access the permissionless Decentralised Finance \(DeFi\) economy, thereby lowering the barrier to individual financial participation in a region of the world with a high potential of growth and impact.

We are committed to and focused on Asia,  as we believe that employing a localised approach with a deep cultural awareness will be key to mass adoption.
