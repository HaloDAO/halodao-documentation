# General FAQs

### **What is DeFi?**

Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\) is a movement that aims to revolutionize our financial industry by removing intermediaries and distributing the margins or fees back to end users. This new financial landscape gives you some of \(but not limited to\) the following main benefits. 

1. Earn fees while you provide liquidity.
2. As a token holder of a particular DeFi protocol, you get to participate in making decisions on its future and policies.

That being said, the space is young and only starting to get battle tested. HaloDAO leverages previously audited code and any changes are audited prior to launch, but proceed with absolute caution and do your own research before providing any liquidity to the protocol.

## What is an Automated Market Maker \(AMM\)?

An Automated Market Maker \(AMM\) is basically a Decentralized Exchange \(DEX\) that uses an algorithm to automatically determine the price of a trade \(swap\) resulting in optimized liquidity flow and mitigated price slippage. Traditional \(centralized\) exchanges use an orderbook to match buy and sell orders.

## What is a liquidity pool?

A liquidity pool is a smart contract that holds a set of token reserves in specific ratios between n number of tokens. In our initial liquidity mining program, we use Balancer Liquidity Pools to bootstrap and reward liquidity until we launch our full AMM.

## What is a liquidity provider?

The entity, individual or smart contract that either;

1. Deposits USD pegged stablecoins as collateral into the Halo Protocol to mint synthetic stablecoins. This Liquidity Provider \(LP\) earns HALO governance tokens proportionate to his/her liquidity. 
2. Or provides liquidity into an AMM pool supporting trades between other cryptocurrencies and a HaloDAO synthetic stablecoin.

## What is an asset-backed stablecoin?

An ERC20 stablecoin issued by a licensed financial institution in the relevant jurisdiction \(such as one licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in Singapore or the Bankgo Sentral ng Pilipinas in the Philippines\) that functions as a claim against fiat \(physical notes issued by the relevant central bank\) held as collateral on a 1 to 1 basis. An example would be 1 xSGD backed by 1 SGD in the bank account of the licensed issuer. This is similar to how USDC is issued and backed by US Dollars held in a traditional reserve account.

## What is a s**ynthetic stablecoin**?

In contrast to an asset-backed stablecoin, a synthetic stablecoin is issued from cryptocurrency collateral instead of fiat collateral issued by a central bank. This synthetic is built to “mirror” the price of the target currency, though synthetics are usually more volatile \(but not to the degree of non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies like Ether or Bitcoin\) compared to asset-backed stablecoins.

A preexisting example of a synthetic stablecoin is DAI of MakerDAO, which accepts Ether and other volatile cryptocurrencies as collateral to mint DAI on a 1 to 1 basis with the US Dollar. There are other mechanisms in play, such as a stability mechanism and expectations of arbitrage among rationale market actors, but this surface-level definition suffices for context.  


## **What is an On/Off Ramp?**

The licensed cryptocurrency exchange or financial service entity that allows users to exchange local stablecoins \(whether asset backed or synthetic\) for fiat or vice-versa.
