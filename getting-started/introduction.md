# More Introduction

HaloDAO is a stablecoin marketplace built to facilitate the minting of synthetics pegged to various Asian currencies, a stablecoin optimised automated market maker to exchange between Asian asset-backed stablecoins and synthetics, and a lending market to generate yield for local currency farming. This regional protocol is primarily developed for the Southeast Asian region, home to 655 million people.

We aim to create a foundational layer for the Southeast Asian digital economy by;

1. Collateralising USD pegged asset back stablecoins as collateral to mint synthetic local stablecoins, relying on the UMA Protocol for their [priceless financial contracts](https://docs.umaproject.org/getting-started/synthetic-tokens) and optimistic oracle services. 
2. Building a stablecoin optimized AMM that efficiently facilitates swaps and minimizes slippage between differently priced stablecoins \(whereas Curve is only optimised for similarly priced tokens\)
3. Bootstrapping a lending market, such as Compound and Aave that enables a foundational money lego to generate local currency derived yield off of permissionless lending and borrowing
