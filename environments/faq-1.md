# FAQ

## How can I access the Production and Beta Apps?

The production app lives on [https://app.halodao.com/](https://app.halodao.com/) and its' contracts are deployed to Ethereum mainnet (Polygon, BSC and many other EVM compatible chains coming soon).&#x20;

The beta app, however, is deployed on [http://beta.app.halodao.com/](http://beta.app.halodao.com/) BUT its' contracts are ALSO deployed to Ethereum mainnet.&#x20;

## What tokens are used on the Beta App vs Production App?

The Beta App is essentially a clone of everything on Production plus newly finished products that are undergoing audit and bug bounties. However, it has all the same value accrual mechanisms as the Production protocol, except it uses an entirely different token called Lollipop (LPOP). Refer to the below table for the protocol components/mechanics compared across Apps.&#x20;
