## How is HaloDAO different from other DeFi protocols?

HaloDAO aims to enable three fundamental consumer use cases of Shopping, Spending and Saving as we move down our roadmap. However, in order to enable those high level use cases, we first need to build the permissionless liquidity that will enable users to easily access the DeFi economy, thereby lowering one of the barriers to individual financial participation in each region. 

## What can users do on HaloDAO?

## What is HALO?

HALO is the ERC20 governance token, limited to 100,000,000 supply to be distributed over 5 years that enables holders to participate in governance.

## What are HALO Rewards?

Liquidity providers \(LPs\) earn HALO tokens that are auto vested in HaloDAO's Rainbow vesting contract. The longer an LP vests, the more HALO is earned. The best part is that there is no lockup period whatsoever, unlike other protocols. The next section immediately below explains how this unique vesting mechanism works.

## What is the Rainbow Pool?

When users provide liquidity to any of HaloDAOâ€™s products, they will automatically earn HALO proportionate to their liquidity provided. That HALO will be automatically vested in the Rainbow Contract. ****Read more about how that works [here](products/dessert-pool/how-vesting-works.md).

## **How do I get HALO tokens**?

Users get HALO tokens when they provide liquidity. Go to [Farm](https://app.halodao.com/#/farm) page and stake your LP tokens. Refer to the [How to Farm](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-farm.md) user guide.

## **How do I get Rainbow Drops \(RNBW\)**?

There are two ways of getting RNBW:

* by providing liquidity on the [Farm](https://app.halodao.com/#/farm) page \(Coming Soon\) 
* by manually vesting HALO tokens into the [Rainbow Pool](https://app.halodao.com/#/vesting) page. See the [How to Vest](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-vest-dessert-pool/).

## **What is the difference between HALO and RNBW tokens?**

HALO is the governance token of the HaloDAO protocol, while RNBW functions as a vesting token and a claim on underlying HALO rewards tokens first earned by staking LP tokens. Read more on how that works [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-farm.md) and [here](products/dessert-pool/how-vesting-works.md)**.**

## Can I claim my HALO Rewards anytime?

Yes! While HALO rewards are auto vested into the Rainbow contract, it is not locked and they can claim it anytime. Read about it [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-vest-dessert-pool/how-to-claim-harvest.md).
