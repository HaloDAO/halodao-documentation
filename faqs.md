## How is HaloDAO different from other DeFi protocols?

HaloDAO aims to enable three fundamental consumer use cases of Shopping, Spending and Saving as we move down our roadmap. However, in order to enable those high level use cases, we first need to build the permissionless liquidity that will enable users to easily access the DeFi economy, thereby lowering one of the barriers to individual financial participation in each region. 

## What can users do on HaloDAO?

## What is RNBW \(Rainbow Candy\)?

RNBW is the ERC20 governance token with an initial supply of 100,000,000. It is mintable as long as the cap is not locked by governance vote. The initial supply will be distributed over 5 years.

## What are RNBW Rewards?

Liquidity providers \(LPs\) earn RNBW tokens that are auto vested in HaloDAO's Rainbow vesting contract. The longer an LP vests, the more RNBW is earned. The best part is that there is no lockup period whatsoever, unlike other protocols. The next section immediately below explains how this unique vesting mechanism works.

## What is the Rainbow Pool?

When users provide liquidity to any of HaloDAOâ€™s products, they will automatically earn RNBW proportionate to their liquidity provided. That RNBW will be automatically vested in the Rainbow Contract. ****Read more about how that works [here](products/rainbow-pool/how-vesting-works.md).

## **How do I get RNBW tokens**?

Users get RNBW tokens when they provide liquidity. Go to [Farm](https://app.halodao.com/#/farm) page and stake your LP tokens. Refer to the [How to Farm](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-farm.md) user guide.

## **How do I get xRNBW**?

There are two ways of getting xRNBW:

* by providing liquidity on the [Farm](https://app.halodao.com/#/farm) page \(Coming Soon\) 
* by manually vesting RNBW tokens into the [Rainbow Pool](https://app.halodao.com/#/vesting) page. See the [How to Vest](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-vest-dessert-pool/).

## **What is the difference between RNBW and xRNBW tokens?**

RNBW is the governance token of the HaloDAO protocol, while xRNBW functions as a vesting token and a claim on underlying RNBW rewards tokens first earned by staking LP tokens. Read more on how that works [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-farm.md) and [here](products/rainbow-pool/how-vesting-works.md)**.**

## Can I claim my RNBW Rewards anytime?

Yes! While RNBW rewards are auto vested into the Rainbow contract, it is not locked and it can be claimed anytime. Read about it [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-vest-dessert-pool/how-to-claim-harvest.md).
