## How is HaloDAO different from other DeFi protocols?

HaloDAO aims to create a "Common Asian Market" built on asset-backed stablecoins in order to enable consumer facing use cases of Shopping, Sending \(money\), and Saving \(via high yield\) for Asia's emerging economies. 

With a greater supply of local stablecoins, users will be able to access the permissionless Decentralised Finance \(DeFi\) economy, thereby lowering the barrier to individual financial participation in a region.

## What is HALO?

HALO is the ERC20 governance token, limited to 100,000,000 supply to be distributed over 5 years that enables holders to participate in governance.

## What is HALO Rewards?

Halo Rewards is the incentivization program for HaloDAO liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn HALO tokens which are represented by DSRT tokens. 

The more and the longer you stake, the more HALO tokens you can earn.

## What is DESSERT?

When you provide liquidity to any of HaloDAOâ€™s products, you will automatically earn HALO proportionate to your liquidity provided. That HALO will be automatically vested in DESSERT Contract. ****Read more about how that works [here](products/dessert-pool/how-vesting-works.md).

## **What is the difference between HALO and DSRT \(Dessert\) tokens?**

HALO is the governance token of the HaloDAO protocol, while DSRT functions as a vesting token and a claim on underlying  HALO rewards tokens that you have earned when you farm/stake your LP tokens. Read more on how that works [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-farm.md) and [here](products/dessert-pool/how-vesting-works.md)**.**

## Can I claim my HALO Rewards anytime?

Yes! While your HALO rewards are vested into the Dessert contract, it is not locked and you can claim it anytime. Read about it [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-vest-dessert-pool/how-to-claim-harvest.md).
