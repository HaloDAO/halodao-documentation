## How is HaloDAO different from other DeFi protocols?

HaloDAO aims to create the decentralised finance infrastructure on which innovation can be built upon. To enable Sending \(stablecoins\) and Saving \(via high yield\) for local economies. 

With a greater supply of local asset backed stablecoins, users will be able to access the permissionless Decentralised Finance \(DeFi\) economy, thereby lowering the barrier to individual financial participation in a region.

## What is HALO?

HALO is the ERC20 governance token, limited to 100,000,000 supply to be distributed over 5 years that enables holders to participate in governance.

## What is HALO Rewards?

Halo Rewards is the incentivization program for HaloDAO liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn HALO tokens which are auto vested in HaloDAO's Rainbow vesting contract - but without locking tokens for any amount of time. Liquidity provider will get Rainbow Drop tokens \(RNBW\). The next section immediately below explains what these RNBW tokens are. 

The more and the longer you stake, the more HALO tokens you can earn.

## What is Rainbow \(RNBW\)?

When you provide liquidity to any of HaloDAOâ€™s products, you will automatically earn HALO proportionate to your liquidity provided. That HALO will be automatically vested in the Rainbow Contract. ****Read more about how that works [here](products/dessert-pool/how-vesting-works.md).

## **What is the difference between HALO and RNBW tokens?**

HALO is the governance token of the HaloDAO protocol, while RNBW functions as a vesting token and a claim on underlying HALO rewards tokens that you have earned when you farm/stake your LP tokens. Read more on how that works [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-farm.md) and [here](products/dessert-pool/how-vesting-works.md)**.**

## Can I claim my HALO Rewards anytime?

Yes! While your HALO rewards are vested into the Rainbow contract, it is not locked and you can claim it anytime. Read about it [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-vest-dessert-pool/how-to-claim-harvest.md).
