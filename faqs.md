## How is HaloDAO different from other DeFi protocols?

HaloDAO aims to create the decentralised finance infrastructure on which innovation can be built upon. To enable Sending \(stablecoins\) and Saving \(via high yield\) for local economies. 

With a greater supply of local asset backed stablecoins, users will be able to access the permissionless Decentralised Finance \(DeFi\) economy, thereby lowering the barrier to individual financial participation in a region. 

## What can users do on HaloDAO?

## What is HALO?

HALO is the ERC20 governance token, limited to 100,000,000 supply to be distributed over 5 years that enables holders to participate in governance.

## What is HALO Rewards?

Halo Rewards is the incentivization program for HaloDAO liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn HALO tokens which are auto vested in HaloDAO's Rainbow vesting contract - but without locking tokens for any amount of time. Liquidity provider will get Rainbow Drop tokens \(RNBW\). The next section immediately below explains what these RNBW tokens are. 

The more and the longer you stake, the more HALO tokens you can earn.

## What is Rainbow \(RNBW\)?

When users provide liquidity to any of HaloDAOâ€™s products, they will automatically earn HALO proportionate to their liquidity provided. That HALO will be automatically vested in the Rainbow Contract. ****Read more about how that works [here](products/dessert-pool/how-vesting-works.md).

## **How do I get HALO tokens**?

Users get HALO tokens when they provide liquidity. Go to [Farm](https://app.halodao.com/#/farm) page and stake your LP tokens. Refer to the [How to Farm](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-farm.md) user guide.

## **How do I get Rainbow Drops \(RNBW\)**?

There are two ways of getting RNBW:

1. Users get RNBW when they start earning HALO upon providing liquidity from the [Farm](https://app.halodao.com/#/farm) page. 
2. Users can manually vest their HALO tokens from the [Rainbow Pool](https://app.halodao.com/#/vesting) page. Refer to [How to Vest](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-vest-dessert-pool/) user guide.

## **What is the difference between HALO and RNBW tokens?**

HALO is the governance token of the HaloDAO protocol, while RNBW functions as a vesting token and a claim on underlying HALO rewards tokens that users have earned when they farm/stake your LP tokens. Read more on how that works [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-farm.md) and [here](products/dessert-pool/how-vesting-works.md)**.**

## Can I claim my HALO Rewards anytime?

Yes! While the users' HALO rewards are vested into the Rainbow contract, it is not locked and they can claim it anytime. Read about it [here](get-started/how-to-earn/how-to-vest-dessert-pool/how-to-claim-harvest.md).
