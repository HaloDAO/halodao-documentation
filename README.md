**HaloDAO brings the Forex \(FX\) market into DeFi in three ways:**

**Swap, Lend/Borrow, and Receive Yield.**
{% endhint %}

HaloDAO enables permissionless liquidity for Asian asset-backed stablecoins. 

Asia houses inherently disconnected economies and legal jurisdictions, which makes cross-border commerce inaccesible and expensive. Limited liquidity is also a known problem in DeFi right now. 

**HaloDAO aims to address these issues by:** 

* Using asset-backed stablecoins to build On-Demand Liquidity \(ODL\).
* Creating more on and off-ramps integrations with existing wallets and exchanges around Asia.
* Building optimized products to facilitate efficient, on-demand currency exchange and a stablecoin specific lending market that provides high-interest yields on local currencies.

This allows anyone to **swap, lend/borrow and receive yields** in asset-backed stablecoins.

**üê∞Our Astro Bunny's story:**

Astro Bunny is on an intergalactic exploration to find new desserts. His first stop to find these delicious treats is the Halo Planet! There he can trade, lend and borrow ingredients to put together the best mix of dessert yields to bring back home.

Come join us, we are going intergalactic!
