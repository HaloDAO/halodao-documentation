**HaloDAO connects traditional and decentralised finance by providing the decentralised infrastructure for next generation payments and settlement. We begin with the core money legos of Swap, Lend/Borrow, supported by Yield. **

**Our Thesis:** The future of DeFi and crypto is one that will enable individuals to buy goods and services using asset backed stablecoins, pegged at a 1 to 1 basis with various local currencies. Very few will be willing to buy ice cream with Bitcoin.

**Situation:** We are still far from this future of mass adoption and no asset-backed stablecoin has achieved widespread adoption. USD pegged stablecoins have filled a large need for trading in crypto markets, but everyday users still cannot directly use it for everyday purchases. 

**HaloDAO aims to address these issues by:** 

* Building and incentivising on and off-ramps integrations with existing wallets and exchanges.
* Building an efficient, on-demand currency exchange via On Demand Liquidity (ODL)
* Building stablecoin specific lending market that provides high-interest yields on local currencies.
* Briding the previous 2 products between L1 and L2 for scalable liquidity and yield
