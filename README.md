**HaloDAO connects traditional and decentralised finance by providing the decentralised infrastructure for next generation payments and settlement. We begin with the core money legos of Swap, Lend/Borrow, supported by Yield.**

**Our Thesis:** The future of DeFi and crypto is one that will enable individuals to buy goods and services using asset backed stablecoins, pegged at a 1 to 1 basis with various local currencies. Very few will be willing to buy ice cream with Bitcoin.

**Situation:** We are still far from this future of mass adoption and no asset-backed stablecoin has achieved widespread adoption. USD pegged stablecoins have filled a large need for trading in crypto markets, but everyday users still cannot directly use it for everyday purchases. 

**HaloDAO aims to address these issues by:** 

* Building and incentivising on and off-ramps integrations with existing wallets and exchanges.
* Facilitating an efficient, on-demand currency exchange via On Demand Liquidity \(ODL\) and a stablecoin specific lending market that provides high-interest yields on local currencies.

**Launching "v0":** We initially build liquidity for Asian asset-backed stablecoins, due to strong money flows and availability of ramps support in the region. As we progress in our roadmap, we will rapidly expand globally

Our initial product in V0 allows anyone to **receive yields** in exchange for contributing liquidity to asset-backed stablecoins pools.

**The content of this docs site is constantly evolving and will be written in the form of a high-level introduction until we reach the next step in our roadmap \(v1\) where we will have ironed out and proven more detailed architectures and processes.**
