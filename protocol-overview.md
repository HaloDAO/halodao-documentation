# ðŸ”­ Protocol Overview

![](<.gitbook/assets/HaloDAO\_protocol overview\_Updated-2.png>)

HaloDAO aims to incentivize and build asset-backed stablecoin liquidity by establishing the foundational money lego of DeFi. However, rather than using ETH or BTC to generate synthetic USD stablecoins as initial protocols have done, HaloDAO will;

1. Build an Automated Market Maker (AMM) to enable efficient trades between stablecoins&#x20;
2. Build a Lending Market to allow more capital efficient lending and borrowing of stablecoins

One effect of launching two fundamental money legos under one protocol is the ability to replicate the early "recycling" of superfluid capital that contributed to the rapid rise of Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi. HaloDAO aims to replicate this behavior specifically for stablecoin liquidity.&#x20;
